#### Overview ####

The ``forna`` package provides a web interface for displaying RNA secondary
structures using the [force-directed graph
layout](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Force-Layout) provided by the
[d3.js visualization library](http://d3js.org/). 

The front end makes use of [Bootstrap](getbootstrap.com) and
[Knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com/) for the user interfact while the back end
uses [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) to serve the static files and provide a
REST API. The RNA structure manipulation and graph construction is created
using the python [forgi](http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~pkerp/forgi/) RNA
structure manipulation library and the provided ``forna.py`` script. We heavily
depend on the python bindings of the [ViennaRNA](http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/) package.

#### Usage ####

Click on ``Add Molecule`` to draw a new secondary structure. The input should
contain a sequence and a secondary structure in dot-bracket notation:

```
GCUUCAUAUAAUCCUAAUGAUAUGGUUUGGGAGUUUCUACCAAGAGCCUUAAACUCUUGAUUAUGAAGUG
((((((((((..((((((.........))))))......).((((((.......))))))..)))))))))
```

You can also use the **FASTA** format to add multiple molecule at once. If you do
not enter a structure, it will calculate the MFE structure at 37Â°C for you.

**Zooming** can be accomplished using the mouse wheel.
Dragging the canvas leads to **panning**.

##### Circular RNA #####

Circular RNA molecules can be specified by adding an asterisk(*) to the end
of the structure. This simply adds a link between the first and last nucleotides.
Example:

```
>x
ACCCAAACAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
...((...))..((..))...*
```

##### Colors #####

###### Position ######

Color the nucleotides according to their position in the molecule. Lower numbered
nucleotides are closer to the 5' end and are colored green. Nucleotides in the middle
are colored yellow whereas nucleotides near the 3' end are colored red.

###### Structure ######

Color the nucleotides according to the type of structure that they are in:

**Green**: Stems (canonical helices)
**Red**: Multiloops (junctions)
**Yellow**: Interior Loops
**Blue**: Hairpin loops
**Orange**: 5' unpaired region
**Light Blue**: 3' unpaired region

###### Sequence ######

Color according to the nucleotide types: 

**Yellow**: Adenine
**Green**: Cytosine
**Blue**: Uridine
**Red**: Guanine

#### Runing Locally ####

The server can be run locally on your machine. It depends on the [forgi](http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~pkerp/forgi/) library and needs the [ViennaRNA](http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/) package installed with python bindings enabled. 
Further, you need to downlaod the [MC-Annotate](http://major.iric.ca/MajorLabEn/MC-Tools.html) program
and make it executeable by the server script.
To run it use the following command:

```shell
python forna_server.py -s -d
```

Documentation about the available options is provided using the ``-h`` option.
